## A new programming book for non-biologists

Since writing and publishing _Python for Biologists_ I occasionally get email from folks who found the books useful, and want to pass them on to non-scientist friends. This is, of course, very gratifying to hear, but the problem is that the examples and exercises won't make much sense to anyone without a biology background.

With this in mind, [here's my first programming book for non-scientists](http://www.amazon.com/Python-complete-beginners-friendly-experience/dp/1514376989/):

As the title suggests it's suitable for anyone just getting started with programming, and assumes no background in biology or even science. The only thing it shares with _Python for Biologists_ is some of the text and a friendly, approachable style. If you have friends outside biology who are interested in programming, please send them along!

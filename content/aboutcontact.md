## About me

<img src="/images/profile.jpeg" alt="drawing" width="300" style="float:right; margin:50px;"/>


I'm a freelance trainer specialising in teaching programming (mostly Python) and Linux skills to researchers in the field of biology. I trained as a biologist and completed my PhD in large-scale phylogenetics in 2007, then held a number of academic positions at the University of Edinburgh ending in a two year stint as Lecturer in Bioinformatics. I launched Python for Biologists in 2015 and have been teaching and writing full-time ever since.

## Contact

If you want to talk about programming, teaching programming, Python, or biology, then I want to hear from you. Email is my preferred method; my email address is martin@pythonforbiologists.com. 

I’m also on Twitter as pythonforbiologists, but I don’t check it as often as my email.

I live and work in Edinburgh, Scotland. If you’re close enough to meet up in person, I am always happy to chat about programming/Python/teaching/anything else.

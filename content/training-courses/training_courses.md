# Training courses

I run intensive programming and bioinformatics training courses for researchers and scientific workers of all backgrounds. This page links to the regular courses that I run, but I can also set up custom training courses to suit your group or business. If this sounds like something you'd like to chat about, drop me an email: martin@pythonforbiologists.com.

Due to current restrictions all training courses are taking place remotely; however I hope to resume running in-person courses in the near future. 

## Introduction to Python for biologists

This is my most popular course, which is intended for people with a biological background but with no previous programming experience. The course introduces basic programming concepts with plenty of time to practice writing code and working on your own data. Comments from people who have attended:

*"I loved this course. It started from very basic concepts and gradually came to more advanced tasks. I feel like I can apply knowledge gained during the course to my own data. "*

*"Martin succeeds a 100% at explaining the logic behind and demonstrating during "live" coding session how to break down problems into smaller bits and combine it into a working solution. "*

*"I wasn't sure I would enjoy this as I thought I might run into a lot of issues with misunderstanding what was being taught, but Martin delivers the material in a clear and understandable way. I'm really pleased with myself for making it through these two weeks without feeling like this is beyond my capabilities. "*

## Advanced Python for biologists

This course is aimed at researchers who already have a basic knowledge of Python and want to write more complex programs, deal with larger datasets, or contribute to existing software projects. Some recent comments:

*"Just what I needed to start writing more complex code."*

*"I also liked the fact that Martin spent a good amount of one on one time talking to people helping explain specific concepts and giving people advice on their personal academic projects."*

*"Don't hesitate to sign up if you're intimidated by the "Advanced" course title.  Martin goes at such a clear pace that you'll be accommodated as long as you have any familiarity with coding and an awareness of Python's basic functions."*

*" His course materials are impressive, they're exactly what's needed.  They're interactive and begin with working solutions that we can modify until they break - that's the fastest way to learn."*

## Data exploration with Python

This course focusses on using Python's scientific software libraries to manipulate and visualise large datasets. It's intended for researchers with a basic knowledge of Python who need to explore large datasets and quickly visualise patterns and relationships. 

#### Now available as a book and video course

Can't make it to a classroom course? You can now access the same material in a combined [book and video course](http://127.0.0.1:8000/biological-data-exploration-book).

## Linux and workflows for biologists

This course introduces the Linux operating system, and takes students from the very basics of using the command line to advanced techniques like shell scripting and analysing tabular data.
